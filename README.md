# Todoist widget for Home Assistant

Custom sensor component and Lovelace card that displays tasks from [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).

The widget allows you to close the tasks from your Home Assistant and syncs it back to Todoist.

## üíø Installation

The component consists of two parts:

1. A sensor, which loads tasks with [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/) every 60 seconds;
2. A card for the Lovelace dashboard, which displays tasks and lets you close them.

We will look at the installation of each of them separately below.

> TODO: test if HACS necessary

#### Todoist

You will need some data from Todoist to continue:

1. Get yourself an [API token here](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer).
2. Decide which projects you want to display.
3. Open them in [the web app](https://todoist.com/app) and copy their IDs from the URL.

### Install the sensor

1. Copy the whole [todoist](./custom_components/) directory to the ``/config/`` folder of your Home Assistant installation.

2. Restart Home Assistant.

3. Now you can add your new custom sensor to the corresponding section in the ``configuration.yml`` file.

   ``````yaml
   sensor:
     - platform: todoist
       api_token: <API token>
       projects:
         - project_id: 9034956420
         - project_id: 6747349569
           display_name: "Tasks for today" # Optional, overrides Todoist project's name
   
   input_text:
     # You need this input for passing data from UI to sensor to close tasks
     todoist_last_closed_task: # Don't change this line
       name: "Todoist last closed task" # This one you may change
       max: 100
       initial: ''
     # A pool of closed tasks to display them as checked despite UI refreshes until sensor updates
     todoist_all_closed_tasks: # Don't change this either
       name: "Todoist all closed tasks"
       max: 255 # This is the limit
       initial: ''
     # Information about the added task
     todoist_new_task: # Neither should you change this one
       name: "Todoist new task"
       max: 255
       initial: ''
   ``````

4. Restart Home Assistant again, check the logs for errors, and give it some time to fetch the data.

   - If you are impatient, you can call the ``homeassistant.update_entity`` service on newly created sensors.

### Add the Lovelace card

Having configured the sensor, it's time to setup the widget.

1. Copy the [todoist-card.js](./www) card to the ``/config/www`` directory of your Home Assistant.

2. Go to your Home Assistant dashboard, click "Edit dashboard" at the right top corner and after that in the same top right corner choose "Manage resources".

3. Add new resource ``/local/todoist-card.js`` and click "Create". Go back to your dashboard, **empty cache, and hard-refresh the page**.

4. Click "Add card", choose manual, and use the config below:

   ``````yaml
   type: custom:todoist-card
   entity_id: sensor.tasks_for_today # Swap to your sensor ID
   max_entries: 8 # Optional, number of tasks to show (default: 10)
   show_project_name: true # Optional, show or hide the project name (default: true)
   show_input_area: false # Optional, show or hide the area for adding a new task (default: true)
   ``````

You can of course add multiple cards to display multiple projects.

## üé® Styling

If you want to change any styles, font size or layout ‚Äî the easiest way is to use [card_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) component. It allows you to change any CSS classes to whatever you want.
